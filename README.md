# crossy_roadster
An Linux improvement with built-in minilibx of the our original school project cub3D (https://github.com/fankahou/cub3D/tree/main)

Manual:
Just open the terminal and run "cd <current-dir>" to the current directory, run "make" and run "./crossy_roadster".
(You can also run "make bonus" in Terminal, and run "./multiplayer" for 2 players playing at the same time!)
